# SafeSound

### The problem
For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
About 85 to 90 percent of sexual assaults reported by college women are perpetrated by someone known to the victim One in 5 Women and One in 16 Men are sexually assaulted while in college. Three out of four sexual assaults go unreported. Why?

The most common reasons for letting a sexual assault go unreported are: shame, denial, fear of the consequences, and a feeling of helplessness.

### Our Solution
Safe Sound aims to provide a platform for those who have been affected by sexual assault from a common perpetuator to unite in solidarity.

We provide resources for you to find on-campus help and aid you in reporting your assault to Title IX. Most importantly we give you a place to enter in your assailants name and find other victims of the assailant. Your name is kept anonymous throughout this whole process and so are other victims. Our goals are to help you find relief, community, and help you to strengthen a case against a perpetrator by uniting with other victims.

We aim to ensure your safery by using only '.ucsc.edu' emails, we ensure that a perpertrater cannot report themselves in the system in order to converse with their victims.
